# An Onitama Server
A digital implementation of the chess-like board game Onitama with an AI opponent.

View the website and play the game [here](http://play-onitama.com/).

The website is hosted on an AWS Lightsail instance. The backend is built in django with a python implementation of the game for computing the AI's minimax moves.

Onitama is a simple game with very rewarding depth. Rules for how to play the game can be found [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/onitama/game-rules.php).
